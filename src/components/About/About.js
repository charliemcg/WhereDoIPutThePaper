              I recently spent a few months travelling around South America and
              soon stumbled into a minefield. A metaphorical minefield of social
              embarassment and practical problems that the guide books did
              little to alleviate. The problem? What to do with the toilet paper
              after it had been "used". I have to admit that I'd imagined that
              in most countries in the world, putting toilet paper down the
              toilet was the accepted method of disposal, but if you're a
              Western European or similar type of person and you decide to do a
              bit of travelling, where you put the paper can suddenly turn into
              a bit of a problem â€“ at least until you get the hang of the
              country and their rules. Now, fair enough, there are plenty of
              guide books and you'll probably have one (if not, feel free to
              click the button below and buy something, it all helps pay for
              hosting), and some books for some countries were quite specific,
              but many aren't, some don't mention it at all and there were some
              glaring omissions when you could really do with knowing; this is
              the product of a spare few weeks when I got back. So, if you're a
              travelling sort and don't have access to, or are a bit shy to ask,
              a local, the bits of information collected here will hopefully
              help you out in those occasional sticky situations.

              If you flick through the countries in this app you'll find out
              what to do with the paper after you've finished with it; I won't
              claim that it's entirely accurate or complete, it's a partially
              exhaustive list of where to put the paper after you've visited the
              little boys' or girls' room. I have tried to be accurate, but
              there's bound to be some mistakes, so let me know if you know
              better (see contact page); and if this information is remotely
              useful or entertaining, feel free to click through a link and buy
              something to help keep this running. And of course, if there are
              instructions given to you locally, follow them. I don't want to be
              held responsible for an international incident if you bung up the
              bog somewhere posh.
